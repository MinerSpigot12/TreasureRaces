Races 3.0
Do you want a racing plugin where you can choose a race upon when you join the first time? Then this is for you! Races allows players to chose their race to get different perks. For example the orc gets Resistance I forever. Now you might ask, how would a player chose their race? When a player first joins the server it automatically forces the player to open a menu from there they are required to select a race if they try to exit the menu it will reopen the menu for them. Create your own CUSTOM RACES, customize what you want the name to be!

The goals of this plugin:

 * The players should be able to fight with their brothers on the battlefield.
 * Bring a new level of PvP to your server.
 * Fighting together with the same race
 * Re-coded at 3.0 for better functionality
